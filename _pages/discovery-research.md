## Problem Statement
It's hard to find accurate, complete, updated information about the human services available in a community. While there are many formal and informal systems set up to provide this information to community members who urgently need it, the systems are redundant and non-interoperable. As a result, the services a client is made aware of can vary depending on which "door" they use to approach the system, and the information they are given may be out of date and incorrect by the time they receive it. The higher the error rate and inefficiency of the system help-seekers must navigate, the more likely they will not access the services they need when they need them and will not have their problems addressed. Additionally, system redundancy increases total maintenance cost, makes it harder for service providers to address complex client needs, and reduces the ability of policymakers, funders, and researchers to evaluate program effectiveness and community health.

## The Existing Environment
The existing system of human services information and referral has grown over many years of effort by multiple parties, and the options available to help-seekers have increased markedly over time. Following is a brief overview of some of the means by which help-seekers can find information on available services. Additional information on how these components are implemented is located in the [Data Ecosystem Analysis](http://humanservices.cahealthdata.org/data-ecosystem/) section of this report.

### Information and Referral Providers
- **Call Centers:** When one thinks of human services information and referral, one likely envisions a call center, specifically 2-1-1. 2-1-1 is an FCC-designated number reserved for community resource referral, similar to 3-1-1 for non-emergency government services and 9-1-1 for emergencies. While federally designated, 2-1-1 services are typically operated by nonprofit organizations, typically on a county-wide basis.
- **Websites:** In recent decades, myriad websites have been created to provide information on available human services. These range from the sites of [individual providers](http://www.sacramentofoodbank.org/) or [government agencies](https://servicedirectory.saccounty.net/results.aspx?service=&dept=8&online=0) to [regional](http://www.homelessresourcesca.org/Cities/Sacramento.html) or [statewide](http://www.weconnect.net/) aggregations of data to those created by organizations intending to provide [information](https://www.1deg.org/) [nationwide](http://purplebinder.com/). Many 2-1-1 services also have websites that allow access to a portion of their data.
- **Paper Directories:** While technology has allowed the creation of new forms of access, [paper directories](http://www.sachousingalliance.org/resources/research-and-reports/the-peoples-guide/) remain available and provide value to people with limited access to online resources.
- **Informal Networks:** Additionally, as with any human activity, informal networks of association, familiarity, and friendship form around the delivery of human services, and individuals take advantage of these networks to refer help-seekers to resources based on their personal knowledge and experience.

The numerous different methods by which help-seekers can gain access to information on available human services can only be seen as a positive. Each individual in need of assistance will have different capabilities and preferences regarding how to access information, and more methods of access in general means more access to services. However, the positives of additional means of access can be offset if different information is available from each source. Human services providers frequently invoke the idea that there should be "no wrong door" for a help-seeker to access services. No matter where a help-seeker turns, they should be able to be referred to the services they need. The downside of the current system is that each different referral service uses its own source of information, updated separately and redundantly from all of the other referral services. Each dataset is only as good as the amount of effort that is put into updating and maintaining it, and it is not uncommon for the entities responsible for updating the data to be chronically underfunded. As a result, each "door" that a help-seeker may turn to can have different information behind it. This can lead to a bewildering landscape that is difficult even for experts to navigate, as elaborated in the following section.

## Evidence from System Users
As the previous section makes clear, a number of different avenues are available to a help-seeker to access information on the services available to them. However, users note a number of inefficiencies and failings of the current system, and many have ideas for its improvement.

### System User Interviews
In the course of our work, we interviewed a number of users of the human services referral system and gleaned much useful information from their experience. We also held a roundtable discussion at which a number of system users shared their insights. These insights include the following.

- A representative from a nonprofit service provider indicated that human services providers tend to be most focused on the "human" side of human services, and do not prioritize things like updating data on services. In her opinion, this makes keeping information on available services updated "the biggest challenge of all time".
- In contrast to longer-running government services, small nonprofit-run programs can quickly appear, fail to achieve their goals, or worse, "don’t have the capacity to develop ... an evidence based model and often don’t even think to collect outcome data", lose their funding, and disappear. These rapidly appearing and disappearing programs are exceptionally difficult to track and provide reliable information on.
- Out of date information on program services creates the impression in potential clients that the service *itself* is unreliable.
- A nonprofit service provider shared the following example: "We have a 26 year old mom with an infant, a 5 year old and an 8 year old.  She relies on public transit to get her from place-to-place and doesn’t have anyone to watch her children for her.  When she needs to access a community resource she has to take all three of her children on the bus with her.  She is more vulnerable to crime since she is a single mom with three young children.  She can easily spend most of her day just trying to access one of these resources.  If she doesn’t have accurate information, it is truly a hardship on her and her children."
- A local government representative indicated that it can be quite difficult to find details on state programs. In particular, finding a knowledgable contact in many state departments with the ability to answer program questions is hard.

### CWDA Member Survey
Through a partnership with the California Welfare Directors Association, we surveyed county human services department staff throughout the state on their experiences both providing and accessing information on human services in their communities. We received 28 responses from 23 of California's 58 counties.

[View graphs of the responses to multiple-choice questions in the survey.](https://sachealthdata.typeform.com/report/kxtwzC/OPS8)

Response highlights include:

- The vast majority (75%) indicate that county case managers use their personal knowledge and/or lists to refer clients to services not provided by the county. A smaller majority (64%) indicate they also use 2-1-1, and a bare majority (54%) indicate that their county has an internal resource directory system.
- While the average satisfaction with the accuracy of the information available about other community resources among respondents was moderately high (averaging 3.64 on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 was "not satisfied", 3 was "ambivalent", and 5 was "very satisfied"), satisfaction with the currency of that data (i.e. how "up to date" it is) was lower, averaging 3.26 on a scale of 1 to 5.
- The majority indicated that the general public or other service providers get information about their services from a county-produced resource, such as the county's website (79%) or some other brochure or directory (61%). Just 57% indicated that these parties get information on county services from 2-1-1, and just 46% indicate they get information from another externally produced directory.
- A majority (72%) indicate that external referral providers get updated information about the county's programs by contacting the county on a periodic basis, while fewer than half (44%) indicate they proactively contact such referral providers when their information changes.
- In addition to the multiple-choice questions listed above, we also asked the open-ended question: "How would you improve the system for collecting, updating, and accessing information about community resources?" Insights gleaned from this question include:

  * Six respondents indicated in their responses that there should be a new centralized location for human services data, while eight responses made clear they assumed 2-1-1 should be used as the centralized resource. Two respondents highlighted the need for a resource that provides information on services in multiple counties to facilitate finding information for clients moving between areas.
  * Seven responses indicated that the onus should be on service providers to update their own data (with two stating specifically that providers should be able to directly change their data in the system), while two indicated the centralized resource should be responsible for surveying service providers. Three indicated that updates to data should be more frequent without naming the responsible party.
  * Five stated that more resources should be made available for updating data.
  * Other responses included requests for better websites and other electronic tools (such as SMS texts) to communicate service information to clients, more refined search capabilities for existing online services, calls to release government internal service databases publicly, and better training for referral staff.

## The Promise of an Open Ecosystem
While the preceding sections make clear the nature and implications of the human services directory problem, a number of developments in recent years have increased the likelihood that the problem can be addressed.

**Government Open Data Portals:** Governments at the [local](http://data.saccounty.net/home), [state](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/), and [federal](http://www.data.gov/) levels have begun releasing data on open data portals, which allow the general public to download, interact with, and analyze the government's data. Among the datasets available are an increasing number that include details on available government services, as well as service providers that are licensed by government.

**Demand-Driven Open Data (DDOD):** Related to the proliferation of open data portals, governments are also experimenting with an open process that allows members of the general public to indicate which datasets they value most, helping government to prioritize its workload. This [Demand-Driven Open Data](http://ddod.healthdata.gov/wiki/Main_Page) process was pioneered by the federal [Health and Human Services Idea Lab](http://www.hhs.gov/idealab/).

**Open Data Standards:** Key to combining data from multiple sources in an open format is the development of open standards for the data. In the field of human services data:

- an open taxonomy of services, called [Open Eligibility](https://github.com/auntbertha/openeligibility), has been developed by [Aunt Bertha](https://www.auntbertha.com/)
- an API standard that allows programs to interact with human services data, called the [Ohana API](http://ohanapi.org/), was developed by a team of [Code for America fellows](https://www.codeforamerica.org/products/ohana-api/) in San Mateo County
- an open data specification, called the [Human Services Data Specification](https://github.com/codeforamerica/OpenReferral), began with the work of both the Code for America fellows and the [DC Open211 Project](http://communityresourcedata.codefordc.org/) and has been expanded by [Open Referral](https://openreferral.org/)
- a [civic service schema](https://www.w3.org/wiki/images/0/03/Services_for_schema.org_%28DRAFT_2013-06-27%29.pdf) has been proposed for schema.org by a group of [Google.org](http://google.org/) engineers, which will allow for a standardized means of publishing human service data on the web

**Dedicated Organizations:** An ecosystem of players focused on addressing the human services directory problem has sprung up, including not just organizations formed to find a solution to this problem, but also organizations built on the prior, closed system of information and referral that see the value of an open system. These organizations include [Open Referral](https://openreferral.org/), [Aunt Bertha](https://www.auntbertha.com/), [Google.org](http://google.org/), [Purple Binder](http://purplebinder.com/), [iCarol](http://www.icarol.com/), the [United Way](https://www.unitedwaysca.org/), [Socrata](https://www.socrata.com/), and many more.
