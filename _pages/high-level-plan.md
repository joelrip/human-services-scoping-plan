## High Level Design/System Map

The pilot project would consist of the following components:

- **Federal, State, and Local Open Data Portals:** A distributed network of open data portals across federal, state, and local agencies would source datasets about community resources.
- **2-1-1 Systems:** Local 2-1-1 organizations that opt-in to the pilot project would expose community resource directory data via application programming interface (API).
- **Core Application:** A core application that includes a database and API would consume relevant datasets across the distributed network of open data portals and store records locally. The application would make data available to external applications via its API to ensure that application developers only need a single endpoint to consume data.

### Network of Open Data Portals

To leverage existing infrastructure and build on advances made in the open data movement, we believe a federated network of open data portals can fill in the gaps where existing information is missing or incomplete, and help automate an otherwise manual process for updating community resource information. This distributed network might comprise portals (including geographic information system “geoportals”) that span different levels of government (see the [Data Ecosystem Analysis section](/data-ecosystem) for examples of datasets across different agencies). An ideal use case would consist of data sets already in Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) format. However, as we discuss later, this may not be necessary. APIs would make these data available to external applications and automation tools would ensure that these datasets are updated daily to reflect the natural flux of community resource availability.

Counties may play a critical role in the data journey. As agents of the state, county human services agencies contract directly with providers that delivery services funded by the state and federal governments. In other words, there is an opportunity to ensure that all of the necessary HSDS data fields are captured through the contracting process and entered into a county database (or even better through the use of electronic contracts) and then synchronized with county open data portals.

### 2-1-1 Systems

Local 2-1-1s would play a unique role in this ecosystem. Under our proposed model, the information and referral systems in use by 2-1-1s would both expose and consume community resource data via APIs. The systems would first expose data for consumption by a core application that would run an algorithm comparing the data with comparable data from the federated network of open data portals. The core application would resolve discrepancies and enable synchronization back to the 2-1-1 systems, so that the information reflects the freshest available.

While 2-1-1 organizations have traditionally been reluctant to open up their data regarding community resources, our research suggests that making this information openly available does not threaten the business model of these referral services. In fact, a more up-to-date database that requires less frequent manual updating might allow 2-1-1s to focus their resources on providing referrals and marketing their services to clients in need, while reducing the duplication of effort that is involved with multiple services updating multiple datasets.

### Core Application

The core application would aggregate information on community resources across the network of data portals, transform those records, and expose them for consumption by external applications. The application could be developed using Code for America's [Ohana API](http://ohanapi.org/) as a starting point. The core application would include:

- **Version Control Protocol:** A version control protocol would sit between the core application and each open data portal, enabling the update of records at the field level rather than at the entire dataset level. The protocol also would identify conflicting fields in common records sourced from multiple data stores.
- **Intelligent Reconciliation:** An algorithm would automate reconciliation between conflicting records in easy cases and escalate records for human review and manual reconciliation in harder cases. The core application would expose the resulting records via its API. Unreconciled records would be flagged as such.
- **HSDS Parsing and Transformation Scripts:** A set of scripts would be developed that map source dataset fields to HSDS format and transform the data to conform to the standard. This is particularly important given that HSDS is a relational data structure (multiple table) and that open data portals are best suited for flat file structures (single table).

## Project Partners

We believe the following organizations would be strong candidates to partner in the pilot project:

### United Ways of California

[United Ways of California](https://www.unitedwaysca.org/) coordinates the work of local United Ways throughout California. Led by President & CEO Pete Manzo, the organization champions the role of 2-1-1 in providing information and referral services to individuals in need. Specifically, California United Ways operate or provide funding for 2-1-1 programs in 28 of the 35 counties where 2-1-1 is available in California.

### CharityLogic

CharityLogic is the company that makes [iCarol](http://www.icarol.com/), Neil McKechnie, COO and Director of Services and Development for iCarol, is leading internal efforts to develop an Open Referral API. Because the company has such substantial market share (used in 30 of 35 California counties), the pilot project would complement existing efforts to create a single statewide database of community resource providers.

### Socrata

[Socrata](https://www.socrata.com/) open data portals are in use by seven California counties, along with the [California Health and Human Services Agency](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/), making them the most popular open data portal vendor in the state. The [Socrata API](https://dev.socrata.com/consumers/getting-started.html) uses RESTful (REpresentational State Transfer) design pattern that simplifies consumption of data by applications. The company has expressed interest in supporting counties that wish to participate in a pilot project.

### U.S. Open Data

[U.S. Open Data](https://usopendata.org/) manages the [Dat project](http://dat-data.com/). Dat is an emerging protocol that enables version control for datasets across a distributed network. [Dat 1.0](http://dat-data.com/blog/2016-02-01-dat-1) was recently released and will power [PublicBits](http://dat-data.com/blog/2016-02-01-announcing-publicbits), a registry for sharing datasets across an open network. This promising technology would allow a single, authoritative version of data to be made available from many sources, while retaining version history at an atomic field level (rather than at the [line-level](http://blog.okfn.org/2013/07/02/git-and-github-for-data/)).

### County Welfare Directors Association of California

The [County Welfare Directors Association of California](http://www.cwda.org/) (CWDA) plays an instrumental role in shaping state policy for vulnerable Californians. The organization represents human service directors from all 58 counties in the state and has actively engaged with our research process. The organization is well-positioned to advise on identifying the specific opportunities when grants or other funding to community resource providers might trigger an update to a dataset regarding available resources in a community.  

### Department of Social Services

The [California Department of Social Services](http://www.cdss.ca.gov/cdssweb/default.htm) (CDSS) has a mission *"to serve, aid, and protect needy and vulnerable children and adults in ways that strengthen and preserve families, encourage personal responsibility, and foster independence."* With leadership from Deputy Director Pete Cervinka and Assistant Director for Horizontal Integration, Adam Dondro, CDSS continues to express interest in supporting efforts that align with their mission and that might integrate well with the California Health and Human Services Agency's open data initiative.
